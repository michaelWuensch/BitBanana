<!-- //////////////// Notice for translators ////////////////////

    First of all, thanks for taking the time to translate this app!


    Here are a few tips to help you while translating:

    Parameters:
    Some strings have parameters, which allows them to show different content.
    Parameters look like this:   %1$s  ,  %2$d  ,  ...
    Every string with parameters has an explanation as comment in the string tag.
    With this information you should be able to move the parameter to the correct place in your
    translated string.


    New line:
    \n is used to make a new line.
    Avoid putting a space before and after \n as this will lead to a space at the end and the
    beginning of a line.
    Correct example:  This is my first line.\nAnd this is my second.


    Special Characters:
    Escape every '  or  " you want to have in your text with a backslash.
    Correct example:  I want to emphasize \"this\" and \'this\' word.

    Escape every % with %
    Correct example:   5 is 10%% of 50

    &  =  &amp;
    <  =  &lt;
    >  =  &gt;

If you run your node on a mobile device or a device that is often offline, you should not route payments and stick to private channels.</string>

    <string name="help_dialog_forwarding">This view shows all the payments that you forwarded for other participants of the lightning network. Moreover you can see the funds you earned for providing that service.\n\nIn the lightning network channels are used for payments. When two participants want to send funds to each other but they do not have a channel open between them, they will have to find other participants in the network that have.\n\nExample:\nAlice wants to send funds to Carol, but does not have a channel with Carol. A direct payment is therefore impossible. But if Alice has a channel to Bob and Bob has a channel to Carol there is a solution. Bob can forward the payment to Carol.\n\nPayments often use multiple forwardings (hops) to finally reach their destination.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_channels">The list of lightning channels represents your lightning funds. Lightning channels are necessary to participate in the lightning network that allows instant and cheap bitcoin payments.\n\nTo \"convert\" on-chain funds to lightning funds you have to open a channel. To \"convert\" lightning funds back to on-chain funds, you have to close an existing channel.\nBoth operation, opening and closing channels, are achieved by an on-chain transaction that costs fees. Therefore, try to keep channels open for as long as possible!\n\nAn easy way to get started with opening channels is to use lightningnetwork.plus.</string>
