<!-- //////////////// Notice for translators ////////////////////

    First of all, thanks for taking the time to translate this app!


    Here are a few tips to help you while translating:

    Parameters:
    Some strings have parameters, which allows them to show different content.
    Parameters look like this:   %1$s  ,  %2$d  ,  ...
    Every string with parameters has an explanation as comment in the string tag.
    With this information you should be able to move the parameter to the correct place in your
    translated string.


    New line:
    \n is used to make a new line.
    Avoid putting a space before and after \n as this will lead to a space at the end and the
    beginning of a line.
    Correct example:  This is my first line.\nAnd this is my second.


    Special Characters:
    Escape every '  or  " you want to have in your text with a backslash.
    Correct example:  I want to emphasize \"this\" and \'this\' word.

    Escape every % with %
    Correct example:   5 is 10%% of 50

    &  =  &amp;
    <  =  &lt;
    >  =  &gt;

    <string name="guardian_certificate_verification">If certificate verification is disabled, you are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Only do this if you know what you are doing.\n\nIt is advised to get the certificate setup correct instead.\nThis means the certificate from your node has to have the hostname included that you are using in this connection setting.

No such risk exists in payments over a direct channel.</string>
    <string name="guardian_custodial_lndhub">This is a LndHub account. Unless you are the host of the LndHub service, this arrangement is custodial.

If you run your node on a mobile device or a device that is often offline, you should not route payments and stick to private channels.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_identity">This is your node on the lightning network.\n\nWhen you tap on your avatar image you will reveal a QR-Code.\nOthers can scan that code and add you to their contacts, open channels with you or send money to you.\n\nThis avatar is unique.\nIt was automatically generated based on your public key and cannot be changed.</string>

    <string name="help_dialog_sign_verify">By signing a message with your node, you can proof that you are the owner of this node. As the signature contains the nodes public key, others can verify such a signed message.\n\nThis feature can be used in different scenarios like proofing identity or for example to login with your node on some services.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_forwarding">This view shows all the payments that you forwarded for other participants of the lightning network. Moreover you can see the funds you earned for providing that service.\n\nIn the lightning network channels are used for payments. When two participants want to send funds to each other but they do not have a channel open between them, they will have to find other participants in the network that have.\n\nExample:\nAlice wants to send funds to Carol, but does not have a channel with Carol. A direct payment is therefore impossible. But if Alice has a channel to Bob and Bob has a channel to Carol there is a solution. Bob can forward the payment to Carol.\n\nPayments often use multiple forwardings (hops) to finally reach their destination.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_channels">The list of lightning channels represents your lightning funds. Lightning channels are necessary to participate in the lightning network that allows instant and cheap bitcoin payments.\n\nTo \"convert\" on-chain funds to lightning funds you have to open a channel. To \"convert\" lightning funds back to on-chain funds, you have to close an existing channel.\nBoth operation, opening and closing channels, are achieved by an on-chain transaction that costs fees. Therefore, try to keep channels open for as long as possible!\n\nAn easy way to get started with opening channels is to use lightningnetwork.plus.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_connect_node_help">Unfortunately these QR-Codes are so big that some devices are not able to scan them. If this is the case for you, you will have to fall back to copy/paste.\n\nIf you need further help, please refer to our setup documentation.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_payer_data_settings">Some payees support or even require you to send them additional information about yourself. For convenience, you can set default values here, so you do not have to enter this information every time. This data is only stored locally on the phone.\n\nPlease note that even with defaults set you will still be able to modify the data when doing a payment. You will also still be able to choose which data is sent at all.\n\nYou are responsible for deciding whether to use real or fake data. As rule of thumb, we advise only sending real data if it is necessary for some reason. (E.g. when you will receive a code by mail, etc.) </string>
    <string name="help_dialog_payer_data_payment">This payee supports or even requires you to send him additional information about yourself.\n\nYou are responsible for deciding whether to use real or fake data. As rule of thumb, we advise only sending real data if it is necessary for some reason. (E.g. when you will receive a code by mail, etc.)\n\nIf a checkmark cannot be unchecked then this data is marked as mandatory by the payee. If you don\'t want to send that data you\'ll have to cancel the payment.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_base_fee">Regardless of the transaction\'s value, you\'ll receive a set base fee for every transaction you forward through the channel. Your total received fee is the sum of this base fee and the fee rate.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_fee_rate">The fee rate is a fee that scales with the value of the transaction you forward through the channel. Your total received fee is the sum of this fee rate and the base fee.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_inbound_fee">Forwarding a payment involves two channels: an inbound channel for receiving a specific amount and an outbound channel for sending the same amount to another peer.\n\nInbound channel fees allow node operators to more efficiently signal where liquidity scarcities occur. By adjusting this value, you can influence the likelihood of a channel being selected as an inbound channel in routing. The specified value represents the fee you will charge or the discount you will offer when the channel is chosen as the inbound channel.\n\nTechnically, a fee can only be set for the outbound channel; thus, for a selected channel pair (inbound &amp; outbound) the inbound fee effectively adjusts the outbound fee by a simple addition. Therefore, a negative number results in a discount on outbound fee, while a positive number will increase it. For security, the total routing fee cannot be negative, ensuring that funds are not lost through routing.\n\nBase fee and fee rate work the same way as they do for outbound fees.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_minHTLC">The smallest value you are willing to forward on this channel in a single transaction.\n\nKeep this field empty if you don\'t want to change the current set value.</string>

However, we recognize that not everyone may require all of these functionalities. With our customizable settings, you have the flexibility to hide any features that are not relevant to your needs, ensuring a tailored experience.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_stealth_mode">Utilize stealth mode to defend your phone against quick physical searches, creating the illusion that BitBanana isn\'t present on your device. This is achieved by replacing your app\'s icon and name and launching a decoy app. However, note that the app\'s icon and name won\'t be changed in the app list in your system settings.\n\nIt is not a perfect solution, but it helps to make the presence of your Bitcoin software less obvious.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_peers">This list displays all the peers currently connected to your node. Peers are essentially other nodes operating within the network. They collaborate by exchanging information, ensuring each node has a clear view of the network\'s status.\n\nAs an example, when your node wants to change something, such as updating a channel policy, it notifies all the peers it\'s connected to. These peers, in turn, relay the information to their own connected peers, creating a ripple effect that ensures the entire network is informed.\n\nYour node establishes connections with peers automatically, typically prioritizing those peers with whom you have active channels. Nevertheless, you maintain the flexibility to manually establish or break connections and access more details about your peers through this interface.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_scanPeer">QR-Codes containing the following are valid:\n\n- pubkey\n- pubkey@host\n- pubkey@host:port</string>

Generate an invoice and pay it with a specific set of own channels, picking one with high outgoing capacity for the first hop and one with high incoming balance for the last hop. This approach incurs fees but achieves channel rebalancing.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_rebalancing">Channel rebalancing keeps your payment channels ready for action! If one side runs low, your channel can only send in one direction, and payments may start to fail. Sending funds in a circular route redistributes balances without the need for on-chain transactions. This view lets you perform such a circular payment. For the best results, pick a channel with high sending capacity and pair it with another that has excess receiving capacity.</string>

This is the fee that will be charged when the channel is selected as inbound channel.\n\nTechnically, a fee can only be set for the outbound channel; thus, for a selected channel pair (inbound &amp; outbound) the inbound fee effectively adjusts the outbound fee by a simple addition. Therefore, a negative number results in a discount on outbound fee, while a positive number will increase it. For security, the total routing fee cannot be negative, ensuring that funds are not lost through routing.\n\nBase fee and fee rate work the same way as they do for outbound fees.</string>

Otherwise, it will be considered failed due to expiration. In case of payment failures or uncooperative behavior, this time window is crucial because it allows participants at that step to take necessary actions, such as cooperatively reversing the transaction (unwinding the HTLC) or uncooperatively settling it on the blockchain.\n\nA higher value in this context enhances the channel\'s resilience against temporary node failures. However, it could potentially reduce the attractiveness of the channel for routing because, in the worst-case scenario, payments might experience prolonged delays. Additionally, in rare cases of stuck payments, the funds of the channel participants allocated to that forwarding event will be locked up for the duration of this time window.\n\n144 blocks is about one day.</string>
