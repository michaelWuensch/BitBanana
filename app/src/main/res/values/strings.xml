<!-- //////////////// Notice for translators ////////////////////

    First of all, thanks for taking the time to translate this app!


    Here are a few tips to help you while translating:

    Parameters:
    Some strings have parameters, which allows them to show different content.
    Parameters look like this:   %1$s  ,  %2$d  ,  ...
    Every string with parameters has an explanation as comment in the string tag.
    With this information you should be able to move the parameter to the correct place in your
    translated string.


    New line:
    \n is used to make a new line.
    Avoid putting a space before and after \n as this will lead to a space at the end and the
    beginning of a line.
    Correct example:  This is my first line.\nAnd this is my second.


    Special Characters:
    Escape every '  or  " you want to have in your text with a backslash.
    Correct example:  I want to emphasize \"this\" and \'this\' word.

    Escape every % with %
    Correct example:   5 is 10%% of 50

    &  =  &amp;
    <  =  &lt;
    >  =  &gt;

    <string name="help_dialog_private_channels">Private channels are not more secure, they are just not visible to the network.\nOnly use private channels if you open a channel to a node that does not route payments or when you do not route payments yourself.\nTo route payments your node should have a very high uptime. If you run your node on a mobile device or a device that is often offline, you should not route payments and stick to private channels.</string>

    <string name="help_dialog_utxos">This list of UTXOs represents all your On-Chain funds.\nIn similar fashion to coins, unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) can only be spent as a whole. As UTXOs can have any value you will simply receive change in form of another UTXO when sending transactions.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_sign_verify">By signing a message with your node, you can proof that you are the owner of this node. As the signature contains the nodes public key, others can verify such a signed message.\n\nThis feature can be used in different scenarios like proofing identity or for example to login with your node on some services.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_forwarding">This view shows all the payments that you forwarded for other participants of the lightning network. Moreover you can see the funds you earned for providing that service.\n\nIn the lightning network channels are used for payments. When two participants want to send funds to each other but they do not have a channel open between them, they will have to find other participants in the network that have.\n\nExample:\nAlice wants to send funds to Carol, but does not have a channel with Carol. A direct payment is therefore impossible. But if Alice has a channel to Bob and Bob has a channel to Carol there is a solution. Bob can forward the payment to Carol.\n\nPayments often use multiple forwardings (hops) to finally reach their destination.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_channels">The list of lightning channels represents your lightning funds. Lightning channels are necessary to participate in the lightning network that allows instant and cheap bitcoin payments.\n\nTo \"convert\" on-chain funds to lightning funds you have to open a channel. To \"convert\" lightning funds back to on-chain funds, you have to close an existing channel.\nBoth operation, opening and closing channels, are achieved by an on-chain transaction that costs fees. Therefore, try to keep channels open for as long as possible!\n\nAn easy way to get started with opening channels is to use lightningnetwork.plus.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_connect_node_help">Unfortunately these QR-Codes are so big that some devices are not able to scan them. If this is the case for you will have to fall back to copy/paste.\n\nIf you need further help, please refer to our setup documentation.</string>

This data is only stored locally on the phone.\n\nPlease note that even with defaults set you will still be able to modify the data when doing a payment. You will also still be able to choose which data is sent at all.\n\nYou are responsible for deciding whether to use real or fake data. As rule of thumb, we advise only sending real data if it is necessary for some reason. (E.g. when you will receive a code by mail, etc.) </string>
    <string name="help_dialog_payer_data_payment">This payee supports or even requires you to send him additional information about yourself.\n\nYou are responsible for deciding whether to use real or fake data. As rule of thumb, we advise only sending real data if it is necessary for some reason. (E.g. when you will receive a code by mail, etc.)\n\nIf a checkmark cannot be unchecked then this data is marked as mandatory by the payee. If you don\'t want to send that data you\'ll have to cancel the payment.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_base_fee">Regardless of the transaction\'s value, you\'ll receive a set base fee for every transaction you forward through the channel. Your total received fee is the sum of this base fee and the fee rate.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_fee_rate">The fee rate is a fee that scales with the value of the transaction you forward through the channel. Your total received fee is the sum of this fee rate and the base fee.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_timelock_delta">In a payment route, each intermediate step defines a specific time window within which it must successfully process the transaction. Otherwise, it will be considered failed due to expiration. In case of payment failures or uncooperative behavior, this time window is crucial because it allows participants at that step to take necessary actions, such as cooperatively reversing the transaction (unwinding the HTLC) or uncooperatively settling it on the blockchain.\n\nA higher value in this context enhances your channel\'s resilience against temporary node failures. However, it could potentially reduce the attractiveness of your channel for routing because, in the worst-case scenario, payments might experience prolonged delays. Additionally, in rare cases of stuck payments, your own funds allocated for the forwarding event will be locked up for the duration of this time window.\n\n144 blocks is about one day.</string>
    <string name="help_dialog_minHTLC">The smallest value you are willing to forward on this channel in a single transaction.\n\nKeep this field empty if you don\'t want to change the current set value.</string>
