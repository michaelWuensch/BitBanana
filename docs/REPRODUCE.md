# Reproduce

## Why is this important?

If a distributed application from an open-source project cannot be exactly reproduced using its provided source code, it presents a major security risk.
Without reproducibility, there is no reliable method to ensure that the distributed application is indeed running the same code that the open-source project has made transparent and auditable. As a result, malicious code could be embedded, potentially granting the developer access to sensitive user data or even your funds.


## What do you want to verify

There are multiple ways to obtain BitBanana, and the verification process depends on the specific release you want to check.

- verify the [Playstore release](REPRODUCE_PLAYSTORE.md)
- verify the [GitHub or F-Droid release](REPRODUCE_GITHUB.md)
