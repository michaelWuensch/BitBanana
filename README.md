‚ö°Ô∏è Superpowers for you and your bitcoin lightning node! Use and manage your node wherever you are. ‚ö°Ô∏è

BitBanana is a native android app for node operators focused on user experience and ease of use.
While it is not a wallet on its own, BitBanana works like a remote control allowing you to use your node as a wallet wherever you go.  
The app is designed with an educational approach, providing the user with guidance on every aspect of node operation.

BitBanana forked from Zap Android. You can find more information about this on the [Rebranding](docs/REBRANDING.md) page.
